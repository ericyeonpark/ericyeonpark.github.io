# 1 Way to Increase Follower Count

One common tip that streamers get when trying to gain more Twitch followers is to stream a lot and frequently. Some sources* suggest streaming 5 hours a day is a faster way to gain followers. With data of the top 1000 Twitch streamers in the world being available on Kaggle, I wanted to check to see if there truly is a relationship between streaming more frequently and an increase in follower count.  

# Examining the Data

The data provided by Kaggle gives us basic data from the top 100 Twitch streamers, updated as recently as of February 2020. As the image below shows, we get data ranging from their channel name to what language they use.

Here is a key to see exactly what each column header(variable) is:
- **Channel:** The streamer's channel name
- **Watch time(Minutes):** The total amount of time that the streamer has been watched on stream (in minutes)
- **Stream time(minutes):** The total amount of time the streamer streamed to their audience (in minutes)
- **Peak viewers:** The max amount of viewers they had at once during a stream
- **Average viewers:** The average amount of viewers they had during a stream
- **Followers:** The total amount of followers they currently have (as of February 2021)
- **Followers gained** The amount of followers gained during February 2020 - February 2021
- **Views gained:** The amount of views gained during February 2020 - February 2021
- **Partnered:** If they are an official Twitch partner
- **Mature:** If the streamer has voluntarily (usually) set their channel to mature, meaning they tell users that there could be profanity, etc
- **Language:** What language the streamer mainly streams in
